        <h4>Omicron BA.2.12 needs to be watched for spread, say experts</h4>
        <p>22 April, 2020</p>
        <p>
          PUNE: New Omicron sub-variant BA.2.12 is more transmissible than BA.2
          and will need to be closely monitored for spread and hospitalisation
          rates, top public health experts told TOI on Thursday. The experts
          said the surveillance data will be key as there's limited information
          on BA.2.12's severity.Sources from INSACOG - India's network of
          surveillance labs - had claimed that Omicron derivative BA.2.12.1 has
          also been found in a few samples from Delhi, but these reports remain
          unconfirmed.
